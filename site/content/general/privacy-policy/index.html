        stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the

        collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers
        to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the

        When it comes to the collection of personal information from children
        under the age of 13 years old, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection
        Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the
        United States’ consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule,

        to protect children’s privacy and safety online.

      <p class="mb-4 ml-2">
        The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy
        law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a
        significant role in the development of data protection laws around the
        globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how
        they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various
        privacy laws that protect personal information.

      <p class="mb-4 font-bold">
        In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the
        following responsive action, should a data breach occur:
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4 ml-2">We will notify you via email</p>
      <ul class="mb-2 list-disc pl-8">

        <li>Within 7 business days</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="mb-4 ml-2">
        We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that
        individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against
        data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This
        principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights
        against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or
        government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by
        data processors.
