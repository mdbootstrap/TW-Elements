  <p class="mb-3">
    Let's have a closer look at how a Tailwind CSS project is set up, what the
    file structure is, and what exactly the basic code does
  </p>

  <!-- TE note light-->

      <strong>Note:</strong> If you stopped the process in your terminal, you
      need to start it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Type <code>npm start</code> command and press enter. MDB GO can start the
      local server again. After that, it should open a new browser window with
      the live preview of your project.
    </p>
  </div>

  <p class="mb-3">
    When you open our project in your code editor, you will see a large number
    of files. I know it may seem intimidating at first, but it is actually quite
    simple and in this lesson we will explain it all.
  </p>

  <h3 class="mb-6 mt-12 text-xl font-semibold"><code>index.html</code></h3>

  <p class="mb-6">
    <code>index.html</code> is the file where we will spend the most time. Let's
    take a look at the code inside.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-3">
    First, let's examine <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section. In the snippet below
    I've added comments explaining what each of the lines does.

  <h3 class="mb-6 mt-12 text-xl font-semibold">Source files</h3>

  <p class="mb-6">
    In the main project folder you will find the <code>src</code> folder with
    two subfolders: <code>js</code> and <code>scss</code>.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-3">
    In the file <code>/src/js/index.js</code> you will find only one line that
    imports the TW Elements library. However, when we start building our
    project, we will import and initialize individual components here.
  </p>

  <div class="mb-10">
    {{< twsnippet/wrapper "/src/js/index.js" "" "mobile" >}}{{< twsnippet/code active=true lang="js" >}}
    import 'tw-elements';
    {{< /twsnippet/code >}}{{< /twsnippet/wrapper >}}
  </div>

  <p class="mb-3">
    In the file <code>/src/scss/index.scss</code> you will find necessary
    Tailwind directives, which simply means that they load individual Tailwind
    CSS functionalities into our project. Later we will use this file to
    customize Tailwind CSS and use its more advanced features.
  </p>

  <div class="mb-10">
    {{< twsnippet/wrapper "/src/js/index.js" "" "mobile" >}}{{< twsnippet/code active=true lang="css" >}}

  <!-- Heading -->
  <h3 class="mb-6 mt-12 text-xl font-semibold">Dist files</h3>

  <p class="mb-6">
    In the main project folder you will find the <code>dist</code> folder with
    an <code>assets</code> subfolder and <code>index.html</code> file. These are
    the so-called <strong>dist files</strong>.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-3">
    Dist files, short for distribution files, are files that are created as the
    output of a build process or compilation of source code.
  </p>

  <div
    class="mb-8 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-primary-400 border-opacity-50 bg-primary-100 p-4 dark:bg-primary-700">
    <p class="">
      Dist files typically contain a production-ready version of the software or
      application, optimized for performance and ready for deployment. These
      files are commonly used in web development, where a source code repository
      containing raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files is built into a
      distribution format that can be served to end-users through a web server.
      The contents of a dist file may include minified and concatenated CSS and
      JavaScript files, compressed images, and HTML templates that have been
      preprocessed or compiled.
    </p>
  </div>

  <p class="mb-3">
    <strong>To put it simply</strong> - during development locally on our
    computer we load a lot of unnecessary code, because it makes our work
    easier.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-3">
    However, when our project is ready to be published on the Internet, we want
    it to be as light, optimized and as fast as possible.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-3">
    Dist files contain minified and optimized code, which is NOT human readable
    (because it doesn't have to be - only source files should be readable), but
    it is adapted for public use by our users.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-3">
    <strong>You should not</strong> change anything in the dist files, as they
    are created automatically after compiling the source files.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-3">
    <strong>To sum up</strong> - we will work on source files, and we will leave
    the job of generating and publishing optimized dist files to Vite and MDB
    GO.

  <p>
    There are many other files in our project, but knowing exactly what they do
    and how they work is not needed in the context of this tutorial. From now
    let's focus on learning Tailwind CSS 🚀
