  <hr

  <p class="mb-3">
    As the name suggests, Tailwind <strong>CSS</strong> is a
    <strong>CSS framework</strong>. It does not contain JavaScript code and does
    not offer solutions related to it.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-3">
    However, that doesn't mean we shouldn't use JS in Tailwind. Quite the
    opposite.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-3">
    By not providing any JavaScript code by default, Tailwind wants to be
    <strong>agnostic</strong> - that is, it has
    <strong>no "preference"</strong> when it comes to the technologies it will
    be used with - be it React, Vue, Angular, Svelte or any other JavaScript
    code - Tailwind CSS will make friends with everyone.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-3">This approach, of course, has its pros and cons.</p>

  <p class="mb-3">
    The most obvious disadvantage is that when using regular Tailwind, we have a
    very limited choice when it comes to interactivity or advanced
    functionalities that we would like to add to our UI.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-3">
    And here libraries such as TW Elements come to our aid - it offers not only
    a number of ready-to-use components, built from Tailwind classes, but also
    provide JavaScript code, thanks to which we can enjoy interactivity and
    advanced functionalities (such as Navbar collapsing and extending on mobile,
    what have we seen in the previous lesson).
  </p>

  <p class="mb-3">
    So let's take a closer look at how this JavaScript and the interactivity and
    advanced features it provides work.
  </p>

  <!-- TE note light-->
  <div
    class="mb-8 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-gray-500 border-opacity-50 bg-gray-100 p-5 dark:bg-gray-700">
    <p class="">
      <strong>Psst!</strong> Don't worry if you don't feel too comfortable with
      JS. We won't be writing JavaScript code here, but we'll just explain
      useful concepts and usage that will help us in future lessons.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- TE tutorial step-->
  <h2 class="mb-6 mt-12 text-xl font-semibold">Data attributes</h2>

  <p class="mb-3">
    Have a look at the Navbar code we have in our current project.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-3">
    Have you noticed elements like <code>data-te-navbar-ref</code> or
    <code>data-te-collapse-init</code> in your HTML code?
  </p>

  <!-- TE Lightbox -->
  <a href="./assets/js-1.png" target="_blank"
    ><img src="./assets/js-1.png" alt="" class="mb-8 w-full rounded-lg border"
  /></a>

  <p class="mb-8">
    These are so called <strong>data attributes</strong>. They are used to store
    additional information in HTML elements.
  </p>

  <!-- TE note light-->
  <div
    class="mb-8 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-primary-400 border-opacity-50 bg-primary-100 p-4 dark:bg-primary-700">
    <p class="mb-3">
      "HTML is designed with extensibility in mind for data that should be
      associated with a particular element but need not have any defined
      meaning. <code>data-*</code> attributes allow us to store extra
      information on standard, semantic HTML elements without other hacks such
      as non-standard attributes, or extra properties on DOM."
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm">
      <a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes"
        target="_blank"
        class="text-gray-500"
        >MDB Web Docs</a
      >
    </p>
  </div>

  <p class="mb-3">
    You don't have to try to remember exactly what each attribute does, let
    alone memorize them.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-3">
    That would be pointless because there are so many of them and you always
    have access to them in the documentation.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-3">
    <strong>What is important</strong> is that you know that the Tailwind
    Elements library uses these data attributes to provide interactivity and
    functionality to components.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-3">
    Without data attributes, TW Elements cannot function properly, so
    <strong>never remove them.</strong>
  </p>

  <!-- TE tutorial step-->
  <h2 class="mb-6 mt-12 text-xl font-semibold">How does it exactly work?</h2>

  <p class="mb-3">
    It may look complicated, but the concept is very simple - data attributes
    indicate to the TW Elements library where what functionality (what
    JavaScript code) should be used.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-3">
    For example, if you look at our navbar's code and look at the item commented
    <code>&lt;!-- Collapsible navigation container --&gt;</code> you will find
    the <code>data-te-collapse-item</code> attribute.
  </p>

  <!-- TE code html -->
  <div class="mb-8">
    {{< twsnippet/wrapper "HTML" "" "mobile" >}}{{< twsnippet/code active=true lang="HTML" >}}


    <!-- Collapsible navigation container -->
    <div
      class="!visible hidden flex-grow basis-[100%] items-center lg:!flex lg:basis-auto"
      id="navbarSupportedContent1"
      data-te-collapse-item>
      [...]
    </div>

    {{< /twsnippet/code >}}{{< /twsnippet/wrapper >}}
  </div>

  <p class="mb-3">
    Recall how in the previous lesson we initialized Navbar by pasting the
    following code into our project:
  </p>

  <!-- TE code javascript -->
  <div class="mb-8">
    {{< twsnippet/wrapper "JavaScript" "" "mobile" >}}{{< twsnippet/code active=true lang="js" >}}

    // Initialization for ES Users import { Collapse, Dropdown, initTE, } from
    "tw-elements"; initTE({ Collapse, Dropdown });
    {{< /twsnippet/code >}}{{< /twsnippet/wrapper >}}
  </div>

  <p class="mb-6">Do you see the <code>collapse</code> import?</p>

  <p class="mb-3">
    It's a bit oversimplification, but you could say it's the following
    instructions for the TW Elements library:
  </p>

  <ol class="list-inside list-decimal space-y-2">
    <li class="">
      Import and add <code>collapse</code> functionality to my project
    </li>
    <li class="">
      Find the element marked with the
      <code>data-te-collapse-item</code> attribute in the HTML code
    </li>
    <li class="">
      Apply the <code>collapse</code> functionality to this element and make the
      Navbar collapse and expand on the mobile view
    </li>
  </ol>

  <!-- TE divider -->

    class="my-7 h-0.5 border-t-0 bg-neutral-100 opacity-100 dark:opacity-50" />

  <p class="mb-3">
    I hope it makes sense now and data attributes will no longer look disturbing
    to you ðŸ˜‰
  </p>

  <p class="mb-3">
