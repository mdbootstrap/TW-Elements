  <p class="mb-3">
    You have completed your project and published it on the web. Good job!
  </p>

  <p class="mb-3">
    However, there is one more important task ahead of us -
    <strong>creating a repository</strong>.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-3">
    Thanks to the repository, you will be able to control changes in your
    project and version them accordingly. Additionally, thanks to the
    repository, you can work on your project with other people in an organized
    way.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-3">
    No technological project can do without a repository. Fortunately, creating
    and managing a repository is super easy with MDB GO.
  </p>

    <p class="mb-3">
      <strong>Note:</strong> You can publish and host your project on the
      Internet for free, but creating and managing a repository is part of the
      paid version of MDB GO.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      The paid version of MDB GO offers a wide range of additional options and
      costs $19 / month. You can find out more

  <h2 class="mb-6 mt-12 text-xl font-semibold">Prerequisites</h2>

  <p class="mb-3">
    To be able to manage the repository you need to have
    <strong>GIT</strong> installed.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-3">
    So before you start the tutorial, make sure you have it installed (it is
    often installed by default or installed with other programs).
  </p>

  <p class="mb-3">
    To check if GIT is installed on your machine, launch a terminal and then
    type the command below:
  </p>

  <!-- TE code terminal -->
  <div class="mb-8">
    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    {{< twsnippet/wrapper "terminal" "" "mobile" >}}{{< twsnippet/code active=true lang="Plaintext" type="terminal" >}}
  
    git --version
  
    {{< /twsnippet/code >}}{{< /twsnippet/wrapper >}}
  </div>

  <p class="mb-3">
    If the terminal shows you the version number, then GIT is installed.
  </p>

  <!--  TE image -->
  <img src="./assets/gitinstall.jpg" class="mb-8 rounded-lg" alt="" />
  <p class="mb-3">
    If you don't see the version number, you need to install GIT. Go to the
    <a
      href="https://git-scm.com/downloads"
      class="font-bold text-blue-500"
      target="_blank"
      >official GIT website</a
    >, download the installer (Windows, Linux and macOS versions available) and
    install it.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-3">Once git is installed, you can proceed to the steps below.</p>

  <!-- TE divider -->
  <hr
    class="my-7 h-0.5 border-t-0 bg-neutral-100 opacity-100 dark:opacity-50" />

  <!-- TE tutorial step-->
  <h2 class="mb-6 mt-12 text-xl font-semibold">
    Step 1 - launch terminal and navigate to your project
  </h2>

  <p class="mb-3">
    If you closed the terminal after the previous lesson, you need to restart it
    and go to the location of your project.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-3">
    Type the command <code>cd</code> (it means going to the specified path) and
    paste the path to the folder where you have your project.
  </p>

  <!--  TE image -->
  <img src="./assets/deploy-1.jpg" class="mb-8 rounded-lg" alt="" />

  <!-- TE note primary -->
  <div
    class="mb-8 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-primary-400 border-opacity-50 bg-primary-100 p-4 dark:bg-primary-700">
    <p class="">
      <strong>Remember that your path may be different</strong>, depending on
      where you placed your project and whether you changed the name of the TW
      Elements package folder.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- TE tutorial step-->
  <h2 class="mb-6 mt-12 text-xl font-semibold">
    Step 2 - initialize a repository
  </h2>

  <p class="mb-3">
    To initialize the repository, just enter the following command in the
    terminal and confirm it by pressing enter.
  </p>

  <!-- TE code terminal -->
  <div class="mb-8">
    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    {{< twsnippet/wrapper "terminal" "" "mobile" >}}{{< twsnippet/code active=true lang="Plaintext" type="terminal" >}}
  
    mdb repo init
  
    {{< /twsnippet/code >}}{{< /twsnippet/wrapper >}}
  </div>

  <p class="mb-3">
    You can see quite a lot of logs in the terminal, including some warnings or
    errors. Do not worry about it. If at the end you see a success message
    <strong>"Project [name] successfully created"</strong> then everything is
    ok.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-3">
    In the terminal you will see a link to your repository. You can immediately
    copy and paste it into your browser.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-3">
    When you go to this link, you will be asked to log in.
    <strong>The login and password are the same as in your MDB account</strong>
    (the ones you used to log in to the terminal).
  </p>

  <!-- TE tutorial step-->
  <h2 class="mb-6 mt-12 text-xl font-semibold">
    Step 3 - manage your project and repository
  </h2>

  <p class="mb-6">
    Go to
    <a class="font-bold text-blue-500" href="https://mdbgo.com/"
      >https://mdbgo.com/</a
    >
    and click the <strong>SIGN UP / SIGN IN</strong> button in the upper right
    corner.
  </p>

  <img src="./assets/repo-3.jpg" class="mb-8 w-full rounded-lg" alt="" />

  <p class="mb-3">
    Then log in using your MDB account credentials again (the ones you used to
    log in to the terminal).
  </p>

  <p class="mb-6">
    The <strong>MDB GO DASHBOARD</strong> button will then appear in the navbar
    in the upper right corner. Click on it to go to the MDB GO administration
    panel.
  </p>

  <img src="./assets/repo-4.jpg" class="mb-8 w-full rounded-lg" alt="" />

  <p class="mb-3">
    You will be transferred to the administration panel. Depending on the number
    of projects and your package, you may see different data there.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-6">
    In the <strong>"Latest projects"</strong> section you will see your recently
    published project. If you click on its name, you will be taken to the
    control panel for that particular project.
  </p>

  <img src="./assets/repo-5.jpg" class="mb-8 w-full rounded-lg" alt="" />

  <p class="mb-3">
    Here you can manage your project - grant access to it, rename it, manage the
    repository, set a custom domain and much more. You also have access to the
    analytics panel.
  </p>

  <img src="./assets/repo-6.jpg" class="mb-8 w-full rounded-lg" alt="" />

  <p class="mb-3">
    Most of them are self-explanatory, so feel free to experiment for yourself.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-3">
    We will discuss in detail all the functionalities of the administration
    panel in the next tutorial devoted entirely to MDB GO.
