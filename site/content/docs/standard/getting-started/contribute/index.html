  <!--Description-->
  <p class="mb-3">
    As an open-source project you are allowed to make a contribution.
    Nevertheless please, ask first before starting work on any significant new
    features. It's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined
    after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature. To avoid this
    from happening, we request that contributors create an issue to first
    discuss any significant new features. This includes things like adding new
    components, exposing internal information, etc.

    Opening a Pull Request
  </h2>

  <!--Description-->
  <p class="mb-3">
    Tailwind Elements is an open-source project, so pull requests are always
    welcomed. What we ask you, is that before working on a large change, it is
    best to open an discussion first to discuss it with the maintainers or if an
    issue was already opened, comment your intention of opening up a PR.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3">
    When in doubt, keep your pull requests small. To give a PR the best chance
    of getting accepted, don't bundle more than one feature or bug fix per pull
    request. It's always best to create two smaller PRs than one big one.

      For making everyone lives more pleasant there are couple of general rules:
    </p>

    <ul class="ml-6 mt-2 list-disc">
      <li>
        Works on feature branches. The name of the branch should be the name of
        the feature that is going to be released. For example:
        <code>new-license-page</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        After making changes, we issue a Pull Request to the active branch. The
        active branch is named according to the version we are working on. For
        example: <code>v1.0.0-beta2</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Name of the Pull Request consistent with the name of the branch. For
        example: <code>New license page</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>
