# Tailwind Elements Contributing Guide

This project is in the active development phase. It still requires a lot of work and corrections. If you want to help him grow, please contribute to our repository. However there are a couple of rules and principles commitmend to the workflow.

Please feel free to put up a PR for any issue, feature request or enhancement. Even if you have little to no experience with Tailwind CSS or JavaScript, we'd be more than happy to help you with any information or guidance in order to fulfill your PR.

# General rules

As an open-source project you are allowed to make a contribution. Nevertheless please, ask first before starting work on any significant new features. It's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature. To avoid this from happening, we request that contributors create an issue to first discuss any significant new features. This includes things like adding new components, exposing internal information, etc.

## Proposing new feature / discussing problems

If there is a matter that you want to discuss with us - whatever it is a idea for new feature, something about dev stuff, feedback on the newest release or simply kind wortds - we recommend using [discussions page in Tailwind Elements' repository](https://github.com/mdbootstrap/Tailwind-Elements/discussions).

## Reporting a bug

On the other hand if you found a bug and do not want or do not know how to fix it by yoursels, let us know about it. The best way to do this is a creating an thread at [Github's issues in Tailwind Elements' repository](https://github.com/mdbootstrap/Tailwind-Elements/issues) and describing wrong behavior of component (or whatever buggy you saw).

## Finding a problems to resolve

Never made an open source contribution before? The simplest way to do this is a [finding an issue](https://github.com/mdbootstrap/Tailwind-Elements/issues) that you are interested in addressing or a feature that you would like to add. Important thing: if there is a someon assing to it, this means that someone from our team is working on it. Any other thing - feel free to take a shot and repeair / add something.

# Opening a Pull Request

Tailwind Elements is an open-source project, so pull requests are always welcomed. What we ask you, is that before working on a large change, it is best to open an discussion first to discuss it with the maintainers or if an issue was already opened, comment your intention of opening up a PR.

When in doubt, keep your pull requests small. To give a PR the best chance of getting accepted, don't bundle more than one feature or bug fix per pull request. It's always best to create two smaller PRs than one big one.

## Workflow

For making everyone lives more pleasant there are couple of general rules:

- Works on feature branches. The name of the branch should be the name of the feature that is going to be released. For example: `new-license-page`.
- After making changes, we issue a Pull Request to the active branch. The active branch is named according to the version we are working on. For example: `v1.0.0-beta2`.
- Name of the Pull Request consistent with the name of the branch. For example: `New license page`.
