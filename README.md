Tiny but perfect jQuery scrollbar plugin

Why perfect-scrollbar?
------------------

I worked on a personal project recently, and I was trying to find the jQuery scrollbar plugin that's *perfect*. But there was no *perfect* scrollbar plugin. That's why I decided to make one.

perfect-scrollbar is very tiny but *perfect* (for me, and maybe for most developers) jQuery scrollbar plugin.  
I hope you love it!

Demo: http://noraesae.github.com/perfect-scrollbar/

What does *perfect* mean?
---------------------

*perfect* means...

* There should be no css change on any original element.
* The scrollbar should not affect the original design layout.
* The design of the scrollbar should be (nearly) fully customizable.
* If the size of the container or the content changes, the scrollbar size and position should be able to change.

Then perfect-scrollbar is really *perfect*?
-------------------------------------------

Yes! the only thing that's not *perfect* is my English.

* perfect-scrollbar has some requirements, but doesn't change or add any style on original elements.
* perfect-scrollbar is designed not to have width or height. It's fixed on the right and bottom side of the container.
* You can change nearly all css styles of the scrollbar. The scrollbar design has no dependency on scripts.
* perfect-scrollbar supports an 'update' function. Whenever you need to update the size or position of the scrollbar, just update.
* Additionally, perfect-scrollbar uses 'scrollTop' and 'scrollLeft', not absolute positioning or something messy.

It's cool, isn't it?

Requirements
------------

To make this plugin *perfect*, some requirements were unavoidable. But, they're all very trivial and there is nothing to worry about.

* the container must have a 'position' css style.
* the container must have an 'overflow:hidden' css style.
* the scrollbar's position must be 'absolute'.
* the scrollbar-x must have a 'bottom' css style, and the scrollbar-y must have a 'right' css style.

The below requirement is for perfect-scrollbar &lt;= 0.3.4

* there must be the *one* content element (like div) for the container.

Optional parameters
-------------------

perfect-scrollbar supports optional parameters.

### wheelSpeed
The scroll speed applied to mousewheel event.  
**Default: 1**

### wheelPropagation
If this option is true, when the scroll reaches the end of the side, mousewheel event will be propagated to parent element.  
**Default: false**

### swipePropagation
If this option is true, when the scroll reaches the end of the side, touch scrolling will be propagated to parent element.  
**Default: true**

### minScrollbarLength
When set to an integer value, the thumb part of the scrollbar will not shrink below that number of pixels.  
**Default: null**

### maxScrollbarLength
When set to an integer value, the thumb part of the scrollbar will not expand over that number of pixels.  
**Default: null**

### useBothWheelAxes
When set to true, and only one (vertical or horizontal) scrollbar is visible then both vertical and horizontal scrolling will affect the scrollbar.  
**Default: false**

### useKeyboard
When set to true, the scroll works with arrow keys on the keyboard. The element is scrolled only when the mouse cursor hovers the element.  
**Default: true**

### suppressScrollX
When set to true, the scroll bar in X axis will not be available, regardless of the content width.  
**Default: false**

### suppressScrollY
When set to true, the scroll bar in Y axis will not be available, regardless of the content height.  
**Default: false**

### scrollXMarginOffset
The number of pixels the content width can surpass the container width without enabling the X axis scroll bar. Allows some "wiggle room" or "offset break", so that X axis scroll bar is not enabled just because of a few pixels.  
**Default: 0**

### scrollYMarginOffset
The number of pixels the content height can surpass the container height without enabling the Y axis scroll bar. Allows some "wiggle room" or "offset break", so that Y axis scroll bar is not enabled just because of a few pixels.  
**Default: 0**

How to Use
----------

```html
<style>
  #Demo { 
    position: relative;
    height: 100%; /* Or whatever you want (eg. 400px) */
    overflow: hidden;
  }
</style>
<div id='Demo'>
  <div>
    ...
  </div>
</div>
```
When the html document is like above, just use like this:
```javascript
$('#Demo').perfectScrollbar();
```

With optional parameters:
```javascript
$("#Demo").perfectScrollbar({
  wheelSpeed: 20,
  wheelPropagation: true,
  minScrollbarLength: 20
})
```

If the size of your container or content changes:
```javascript
$('#Demo').perfectScrollbar('update');
```
If you want to destory the scrollbar:
```javascript
$('#Demo').perfectScrollbar('destroy');
```

If you want to scroll to somewhere, just use scroll-top css and update.
```javascript
$("#Demo").scrollTop(0);
$("#Demo").perfectScrollbar('update');
```

Also you can get information about how to use the plugin from code in the `examples` directory of the source tree.
