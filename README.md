Tiny but perfect jQuery scrollbar plugin

Why perfect-scrollbar?
------------------

I worked on the personal project recently, and I was trying to find the jQuery scrollbar plugin that's *perfect*. But there was no *perfect* scrollbar plugin. That's why I decided to make one.

perfect-scrollbar is very tiny but *perfect*(for me, and maybe for the most of developers) jQuery scrollbar plugin.  
I hope you love this!

Demo: http://noraesae.github.com/perfect-scrollbar/

What means *perfect*?
---------------------

*perfect* means...

* There should be no css change on any original element.
* The scrollbar should not affect the original design layout.
* The design of the scrollbar should be (nearly) fully customizable.
* If the size of the container or the content changes, the scrollbar size and position should be able to change.

Then perfect-scrollbar is really *perfect*?
-------------------------------------------

Yes! the only thing that's not *perfect* is my English.

* perfect-scrollbar has some requirements, but doesn't change or add any style on original elements.
* perfect-scrollbar is designed not to have width or height. It's fixed on the right and bottom side of the container.
* You can change nearly all css styles of the scrollbar. The scrollbar design has no dependency on scripts.
* perfect-scrollbar support 'update' function. Whenever you need to update the size or position of the scrollbar, just update.
* Additionally, perfect-scrollbar do use 'scrollTop' and 'scrollLeft', not absolute position or something messy.

It's cool, isn't it?

Requirements
------------

To make this plugin *perfect*, some requirements were not avoidable. But they're all very trivial and there's nothing to worry about.

* there must be the *one* content element(like div) for the container.
* the container must have a 'position' css style.
* the scrollbar's position must be 'absolute'.
* the scrollbar-x must have a 'bottom' css style, and the scrollbar-y must have a 'right' css style.

How to Use
----------

```html
<style>
  #Demo { position: 'relative'; }
</style>
<div id='Demo'>
  <div>
    ...
  </div>
</div>
```
When the html document is like above, just use like this:
```javascript
$('#Demo').perfectScrollbar();
```
If the size of your container or content changes:
```javascript
$('#Demo').perfectScrollbar('update');
```
If you want to destory the scrollbar:
```javascript
$('#Demo').perfectScrollbar('destroy');
```

If you want to scroll to somewhere, just use scroll-top css and update.
```javascript
$("#Demo").scrollTop(0);
$("#Demo").perfectScrollbar('update');
```

Very helpful friends
--------------------

perfect-scrollbar supports [jquery-mousewheel](https://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery-mousewheel). If you want to use mousewheel features, please include jquery-mousewheel before using perfect-scrollbar.

If you want to make this plugin's update function more responsive, [jquery-resize](https://github.com/cowboy/jquery-resize) can be helpful.
