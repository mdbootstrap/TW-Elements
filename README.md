# `perfect-scrollbar`

Minimalistic but perfect custom scrollbar plugin

[![Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/noraesae/perfect-scrollbar.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/noraesae/perfect-scrollbar)

If you want information of old versions&lt;0.6.0, please refer to

## Why perfect-scrollbar?

I was once working on a personal project, and trying to find the jQuery
scrollbar plugin that's *perfect*. But there was no *perfect* one.
That's why I decided to make one.

perfect-scrollbar is minimalistic but *perfect* (for me, and maybe for most developers)
scrollbar plugin working with jQuery or vanilla JavaScript as well.

I hope you love it!

## [Demo](http://noraesae.github.com/perfect-scrollbar/)

[It's on the GitHub Pages](http://noraesae.github.com/perfect-scrollbar/).

## What does *perfect* mean?

*perfect* means...

* There should be no css change on any original element.
* The scrollbar should not affect the original design layout.
* The design of the scrollbar should be (nearly) fully customizable.
* If the size of the container or the content changes, the scrollbar
  size and position should be able to change.
* *New!* It should work with vanilla JavaScript and major tools like
  NPM or Browserify.

## Then perfect-scrollbar is really *perfect*?

* perfect-scrollbar has some requirements, but doesn't change or add
  any style on original elements.
* perfect-scrollbar is designed not to have width or height. It's fixed
  on the right and bottom side of the container.
* You can change nearly all css styles of the scrollbar. The scrollbar
  design has no dependency on scripts.
* perfect-scrollbar supports an 'update' function. Whenever you need
  to update the size or position of the scrollbar, just update.
* Additionally, perfect-scrollbar uses 'scrollTop' and 'scrollLeft',
  not absolute positioning or something messy.

It's cool, isn't it?

## Install

The best way to install and use perfect-scrollbar is with NPM.
It's registered on [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/package/perfect-scrollbar) as `perfect-scrollbar`.

```
$ npm install perfect-scrollbar
```

You can download the latest stable version with download links [here](http://noraesae.github.io/perfect-scrollbar/).
You also can find all releases on [Releases](https://github.com/noraesae/perfect-scrollbar/releases).

If you want to use the development version of the plugin, use the
source files which are not minified. They're in the `src` directory.
The development version may be unstable, but some known bugs may
have been fixed.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/noraesae/perfect-scrollbar.git
$ cd perfect-scrollbar/src
$ npm install
$ gulp # will lint and build the source code.
```


There is a Bower package for perfect-scrollbar as well. It is managed
under the [perfect-scrollbar-bower](https://github.com/noraesae/perfect-scrollbar-bower)
repository. The plugin is registered as `perfect-scrollbar`.

```
$ bower install perfect-scrollbar
```


You can also load it from [cdnjs](http://cdnjs.com/).
It is registered as [`jquery.perfect-scrollbar`](http://www.cdnjs.com/libraries/jquery.perfect-scrollbar).

## Requirements

To make this plugin *perfect*, some requirements were unavoidable.
But, they're all very trivial and there is nothing to worry about.

The following requirements should meet.

* the container must have a 'position' css style.

The following requirements are included in the basic CSS, but please
keep in mind when you'd like to change the CSS files.

* the container must have an 'overflow:hidden' css style.
* the scrollbar's position must be 'absolute'.
* the scrollbar-x must have a 'bottom' css style, and the scrollbar-y
  must have a 'right' css style.

## How to use

First of all, please check if the container element meets the
requirements.

```html
<link rel='stylesheet' href='dist/css/perfect-scrollbar.css' />
<style>
  #container {
    position: relative;
    height: 100%; /* Or whatever you want (eg. 400px) */
  }
</style>
```

I would recommend using the plugin with NPM and CommonJS module system
like Browserify.

```javascript
var Ps = require('perfect-scrollbar');
```

Or you can just load the script file as usual.

```html
<script src='dist/js/perfect-scrollbar.js'></script>
```

To initialise the plugin, `Ps.initialize` is used.

```javascript
var container = document.getElementById('container');
Ps.initialize(container);
```

It can be initialised with optional parameters.

```javascript
Ps.initialize(container, {
  wheelSpeed: 2,
  wheelPropagation: true,
  minScrollbarLength: 20
});
```

If the size of your container or content changes, call `update`.

```javascript
Ps.update(container);
```

If you want to destory the scrollbar, use `destroy`.

```javascript
Ps.destroy(container);
```

If you want to scroll to somewhere, just use a `scrollTop`
property and update.

```javascript
container.scrollTop = 0;
Ps.update(container);
```

You can also get information about how to use the plugin
from code in the `examples` directory of the source tree.

## jQuery

As you may already know, perfect-scrollbar was a jQuery plugin.
And it *is* as well. There's a jQuery adaptor and the plugin can
be used in the same way it used to be used before.

I also recommend using NPM and CommonJS here, but it's not mandatory.

```javascript
var $ = require('jquery');
require('perfect-scrollbar/jquery')($);
```

For sure, you can just import a built script.

```html
<script src='dist/js/perfect-scrollbar.jquery.js'></script>
```

After importing it, you can use the plugin in the usual way.

```javascript
$('#container').perfectScrollbar();          // Initialize
$('#container').perfectScrollbar({ ... });   // with options
$('#container').perfectScrollbar('update');  // Update
$('#container').perfectScrollbar('destroy'); // Destroy
```

## Optional parameters

perfect-scrollbar supports optional parameters.

### wheelSpeed
The scroll speed applied to mousewheel event.  
**Default: 1**

### wheelPropagation
If this option is true, when the scroll reaches the end of the side, mousewheel event will be propagated to parent element.  
**Default: false**

### swipePropagation
If this option is true, when the scroll reaches the end of the side, touch scrolling will be propagated to parent element.  
**Default: true**

### minScrollbarLength
When set to an integer value, the thumb part of the scrollbar will not shrink below that number of pixels.  
**Default: null**

### maxScrollbarLength
When set to an integer value, the thumb part of the scrollbar will not expand over that number of pixels.  
**Default: null**

### useBothWheelAxes
When set to true, and only one (vertical or horizontal) scrollbar is visible then both vertical and horizontal scrolling will affect the scrollbar.  
**Default: false**

### useKeyboard
When set to true, the scroll works with arrow keys on the keyboard. The element is scrolled only when the mouse cursor hovers the element.  
**Default: true**

### suppressScrollX
When set to true, the scroll bar in X axis will not be available, regardless of the content width.  
**Default: false**

### suppressScrollY
When set to true, the scroll bar in Y axis will not be available, regardless of the content height.  
**Default: false**

### scrollXMarginOffset
The number of pixels the content width can surpass the container width without enabling the X axis scroll bar. Allows some "wiggle room" or "offset break", so that X axis scroll bar is not enabled just because of a few pixels.  
**Default: 0**

### scrollYMarginOffset
The number of pixels the content height can surpass the container height without enabling the Y axis scroll bar. Allows some "wiggle room" or "offset break", so that Y axis scroll bar is not enabled just because of a few pixels.  
**Default: 0**
