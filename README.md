# `perfect-scrollbar`

Minimalistic but perfect custom scrollbar plugin

[![Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/noraesae/perfect-scrollbar.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/noraesae/perfect-scrollbar)

## Why perfect-scrollbar?

I was once working on a personal project, and trying to find the jQuery
scrollbar plugin that's *perfect*. But there was no *perfect* one.
That's why I decided to make one.

perfect-scrollbar is minimalistic but *perfect* (for me, and maybe for most developers)
scrollbar plugin working with jQuery or vanilla JavaScript as well.

I hope you love it!

## [Demo](http://noraesae.github.com/perfect-scrollbar/)

[It's on the GitHub Pages](http://noraesae.github.com/perfect-scrollbar/).

## What does *perfect* mean?

*perfect* means...

* There should be no css change on any original element.
* The scrollbar should not affect the original design layout.
* The design of the scrollbar should be (nearly) fully customizable.
* If the size of the container or the content changes, the scrollbar
  size and position should be able to change.
* *New!* It should work with vanilla JavaScript and major tools like
  NPM or Browserify.

## Then perfect-scrollbar is really *perfect*?

* perfect-scrollbar has some requirements, but doesn't change or add
  any style on original elements.
* perfect-scrollbar is designed not to have width or height. It's fixed
  on the right and bottom side of the container.
* You can change nearly all css styles of the scrollbar. The scrollbar
  design has no dependency on scripts.
* perfect-scrollbar supports an 'update' function. Whenever you need
  to update the size or position of the scrollbar, just update.
* Additionally, perfect-scrollbar uses 'scrollTop' and 'scrollLeft',
  not absolute positioning or something messy.
* perfect-scrollbar supports RTL perfectly on both WebKit and Gecko based browsers.

It's cool, isn't it?

## Install

#### NPM

The best way to install and use perfect-scrollbar is with NPM.
It's registered on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/perfect-scrollbar) as `perfect-scrollbar`.

```
$ npm install perfect-scrollbar
```

#### Rails

In the case you would like to have perfect-scrollbar in your Rails application, there is the [perfect-scrollbar-rails gem](https://github.com/YourCursus/perfect-scrollbar-rails).

#### Manually

You can download the latest stable version with download links [here](http://noraesae.github.io/perfect-scrollbar/).
You also can find all releases on [Releases](https://github.com/noraesae/perfect-scrollbar/releases).

#### From sources

If you want to use the development version of the plugin, use the
source files which are not minified. They're in the `src` directory.
The development version may be unstable, but some known bugs may
have been fixed.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/noraesae/perfect-scrollbar.git
$ cd perfect-scrollbar/src
$ npm install
$ gulp # will lint and build the source code.
```

under the [perfect-scrollbar-bower](https://github.com/noraesae/perfect-scrollbar-bower)
repository. The plugin is registered as `perfect-scrollbar`.

```
$ bower install perfect-scrollbar
```

* [Perfect Scrollbar (jQuery)](https://jsfiddle.net/DanielApt/gbfLazpx/)

## Requirements

To make this plugin *perfect*, some requirements were unavoidable.
But, they're all very trivial and there is nothing to worry about.

The following requirements should meet.

* the container must have a 'position' css style.

The following requirements are included in the basic CSS, but please
keep in mind when you'd like to change the CSS files.

* the container must have an 'overflow:hidden' css style.
* the scrollbar's position must be 'absolute'.
* the scrollbar-x must have a 'bottom' css style, and the scrollbar-y
  must have a 'right' css style.

## How to use

First of all, please check if the container element meets the
requirements.

```html
<link rel='stylesheet' href='dist/css/perfect-scrollbar.css' />
<style>
  #container {
    position: relative;
    height: 100%; /* Or whatever you want (eg. 400px) */
  }
</style>
```

I would recommend using the plugin with NPM and CommonJS module system
like Browserify.

```javascript
var Ps = require('perfect-scrollbar');
```

Or you can just load the script file as usual.

```html
<script src='dist/js/perfect-scrollbar.js'></script>
```

To initialise the plugin, `Ps.initialize` is used.

```javascript
var container = document.getElementById('container');
Ps.initialize(container);
```

It can be initialised with optional parameters.

```javascript
Ps.initialize(container, {
  wheelSpeed: 2,
  wheelPropagation: true,
  minScrollbarLength: 20
});
```

If the size of your container or content changes, call `update`.

```javascript
Ps.update(container);
```

If you want to destroy the scrollbar, use `destroy`.

```javascript
Ps.destroy(container);
```

If you want to scroll to somewhere, just use a `scrollTop`
property and update.

```javascript
container.scrollTop = 0;
Ps.update(container);
```

If you want to temporarily disable (but leave visible) the scrollbar, use
`disable` (and `enable` to re-enable it later).

```javascript
Ps.disable(container);
```
Enabling the scroller again can easily be done by calling:
```javascript
Ps.enable(container);
```

You can also get information about how to use the plugin
from code in the `examples` directory of the source tree.

## jQuery

As you may already know, perfect-scrollbar was a jQuery plugin.
And it *is* as well. There's a jQuery adaptor and the plugin can
be used in the same way it used to be used before.

I also recommend using NPM and CommonJS here, but it's not mandatory.

```javascript
var $ = require('jquery');
require('perfect-scrollbar/jquery')($);
```

For sure, you can just import a built script.

```html
<script src='dist/js/perfect-scrollbar.jquery.js'></script>
```

After importing it, you can use the plugin in the usual way.

```javascript
$('#container').perfectScrollbar();          // Initialize
$('#container').perfectScrollbar({ ... });   // with options
$('#container').perfectScrollbar('update');  // Update
$('#container').perfectScrollbar('destroy'); // Destroy
```

## RequireJS  usage

For RequireJS loader, no need to write shim, simply import two libs:

```javascript
require.config({
  paths: {
    perfectScrollbarJQuery: '.../perfect-scrollbar.jquery',
    perfectScrollbar: '.../perfect-scrollbar',
  }
  ...
})
```


and load `perfectScrollbar` in the initialiser of your app:

```javascript
// for vanilla JS:
window.Ps = require('perfectScrollbar');

// for jQuery:
require('perfectScrollbarJQuery');
```


## AngularJS + RequireJS usage

With the require.config settings above, at the beginning of your app module
definition, you can have following code:

```javascript
define([
  'angular',
  'perfectScrollbar',
  'perfectScrollbarJquery'
],
function (angular) {
  var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
  app.run(function () {
    window.Ps = require('perfectScrollbar');
    require('perfectScrollbarJQuery');
  });
  return app;
});
```

And initialise perfectScrollbar in a controller:

```javascript
// by vanilla JS:
var container = document.getElementById('imgLoader');
Ps.initialize(container);
Ps.update(container);

// or by jQuery:
var imgLoader = $('#imgLoader')
imgLoader.perfectScrollbar();
```

## Optional parameters

perfect-scrollbar supports optional parameters.

### handlers
It is a list of handlers to use to scroll the element.  
**Default**: `['click-rail', 'drag-scrollbar', 'keyboard', 'wheel', 'touch']`  
**Disabled by default**: `'selection'`

### wheelSpeed
The scroll speed applied to mousewheel event.  
**Default**: `1`

### wheelPropagation
If this option is true, when the scroll reaches the end of the side, mousewheel event will be propagated to parent element.  
**Default**: `false`

### swipePropagation
If this option is true, when the scroll reaches the end of the side, touch scrolling will be propagated to parent element.  
**Default**: `true`

### minScrollbarLength
When set to an integer value, the thumb part of the scrollbar will not shrink below that number of pixels.  
**Default**: `null`

### maxScrollbarLength
When set to an integer value, the thumb part of the scrollbar will not expand over that number of pixels.  
**Default**: `null`

### useBothWheelAxes
When set to true, and only one (vertical or horizontal) scrollbar is visible then both vertical and horizontal scrolling will affect the scrollbar.  
**Default**: `false`

### suppressScrollX
When set to true, the scroll bar in X axis will not be available, regardless of the content width.  
**Default**: `false`

### suppressScrollY
When set to true, the scroll bar in Y axis will not be available, regardless of the content height.  
**Default**: `false`

### scrollXMarginOffset
The number of pixels the content width can surpass the container width without enabling the X axis scroll bar. Allows some "wiggle room" or "offset break", so that X axis scroll bar is not enabled just because of a few pixels.  
**Default**: `0`

### scrollYMarginOffset
The number of pixels the content height can surpass the container height without enabling the Y axis scroll bar. Allows some "wiggle room" or "offset break", so that Y axis scroll bar is not enabled just because of a few pixels.  
**Default**: `0`

### stopPropagationOnClick
When set to false, when clicking on a rail, the click event will be allowed to propagate.  
**Default**: `true`

### theme
A string. It's a class name added to the container element. The class name is prepended with `ps-theme-`. So default theme class name is `ps-theme-default`. In order to create custom themes with scss use `ps-container($theme)` mixin, where `$theme` is a scss map.  
**Default**: `'default'`

**Example 1:**

Add `theme` parameter:
```javascript
Ps.initialize(container, {
  theme: 'my-theme-name'
});
```
Create a class name prefixed with `.ps-theme-`. Include `ps-container()` mixin. It's recommended to use `map-merge()` to extend `$ps-theme-default` map with your custom styles.
```scss
.ps-theme-my-theme-name {
  @include ps-container(map-merge($ps-theme-default, (
    border-radius: 0,
    scrollbar-x-rail-height: 20px,
    scrollbar-x-height: 20px,
    scrollbar-y-rail-width: 20px,
    scrollbar-y-width: 20px
  )));
}
```

**Example 2:**

Alternatively, if you don't want to create your own themes, but only modify the default one, you could simply overwrite `$ps-*` variables with your own values. In this case `theme` parameter is not required when calling `.initialize()` method. Remember do define your own variables before the `theme.scss` file is imported.


## Events

perfect-scrollbar dispatches custom events.

### ps-scroll-y
This event fires when the y-axis is scrolled in either direction.

### ps-scroll-x
This event fires when the x-axis is scrolled in either direction.

### ps-scroll-up
This event fires when scrolling upwards.

### ps-scroll-down
This event fires when scrolling downwards.

### ps-scroll-left
This event fires when scrolling to the left.

### ps-scroll-right
This event fires when scrolling to the right.

### ps-y-reach-start
This event fires when scrolling reaches the start of the y-axis.

### ps-y-reach-end
This event fires when scrolling reaches the end of the y-axis (useful for infinite scroll).

### ps-x-reach-start
This event fires when scrolling reaches the start of the x-axis.

### ps-x-reach-end
This event fires when scrolling reaches the end of the x-axis.

You can listen to these events either with vanilla JavaScript
```javascript
document.addEventListener('ps-scroll-x', function () {
  // ...
})
```
or with jQuery
```javascript
$(document).on('ps-scroll-x', function () {
  // ...
})
```

## Tips

### Scrolling children inside perfect-scrollbar

You can natively scroll children inside `perfect-scrollbar` with the mouse-wheel. Scrolling automatically works if 
the child is a `textarea`. All other elements need to have the `ps-child` class. This is demonstrated in [`/examples/children-native-scroll.html`](examples/children-native-scroll.html)

## IE Support

The plugin is designed to work in modern browsers, including the very latest
version of IE and Edge. Specifically, it should work in IEs >= IE10. If there
is any issue in the browsers, please [file it](https://github.com/noraesae/perfect-scrollbar/issues).

**The patches to fix problems in IE<=9 won't be accepted.**

When old IEs should be supported, please fork the project and
make patches personally.
